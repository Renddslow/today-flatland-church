  - name: The Way
    summary: |
      The first word in Jesus’ sermon on the mount is μακάριος (_makarios_). We often translate this Greek word as “blessed.” It describes a life that is good. Jesus used this word nine times at the beginning of Matthew 5. This opening to the Sermon on the Mount is often referred to as The Beatitudes. In the book of Matthew, Jesus used this word, _makarios_, four additional times (see below).

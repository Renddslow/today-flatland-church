\lh{1} This is the genealogy of Jesus the Messiah the son of David, the son of Abraham:

\li{2} Abraham was the father of Isaac,
\liIsaac the father of Jacob,
\liJacob the father of Judah and his brothers,
\li{3} Judah the father of Perez and Zerah, whose mother was Tamar,
\liPerez the father of Hezron,
\liHezron the father of Ram,
\li{4} Ram the father of Amminadab,
\liAmminadab the father of Nahshon,
\liNahshon the father of Salmon,
\li{5} Salmon the father of Boaz, whose mother was Rahab,
\liBoaz the father of Obed, whose mother was Ruth,
\liObed the father of Jesse,
\li{6} and Jesse the father of King David.

\lhDavid was the father of Solomon, whose mother had been Uriah’s wife,
\li{7} Solomon the father of Rehoboam,
\liRehoboam the father of Abijah,
\liAbijah the father of Asa,
\li{8} Asa the father of Jehoshaphat,
\liJehoshaphat the father of Jehoram,
\liJehoram the father of Uzziah,
\li{9} Uzziah the father of Jotham,
\liJotham the father of Ahaz,
\liAhaz the father of Hezekiah,
\li{10} Hezekiah the father of Manasseh,
\liManasseh the father of Amon,
\liAmon the father of Josiah,
\li{11} and Josiah the father of Jeconiah and his brothers at the time of the exile to Babylon.

\lh{12} After the exile to Babylon:
\liJeconiah was the father of Shealtiel,
\liShealtiel the father of Zerubbabel,
\li{13} Zerubbabel the father of Abihud,
\liAbihud the father of Eliakim,
\liEliakim the father of Azor,
\li{14} Azor the father of Zadok,
\liZadok the father of Akim,
\liAkim the father of Elihud,
\li{15} Elihud the father of Eleazar,
\liEleazar the father of Matthan,
\liMatthan the father of Jacob,
\li{16} and Jacob the father of Joseph, the husband of Mary, and Mary was the mother of Jesus who is called the Messiah.

\lf{17} Thus there were fourteen generations in all from Abraham to David, fourteen from David to the exile to Babylon, and fourteen from the exile to the Messiah.

{18} This is how the birth of Jesus the Messiah came about: His mother Mary was pledged to be married to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be pregnant through the Holy Spirit. {19} Because Joseph her husband was faithful to the law, and yet did not want to expose her to public disgrace, he had in mind to divorce her quietly.

{20} But after he had considered this, an angel of YHWH appeared to him in a dream and said, “Joseph son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary home as your wife, because what is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit. {21} She will give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins.”

{22} All this took place to fulfill what YHWH had said through the prophet: {23} “The virgin will conceive and give birth to a son, and they will call him Immanuel” (which means “God with us”).

{24} When Joseph woke up, he did what the angel of YHWH had commanded him and took Mary home as his wife. {25} But he did not consummate their marriage until she gave birth to a son. And he gave him the name Jesus.
